**Section 8: Turning State Banks into National Banks!**

1. **Turning Into a National Bank**  
  - If a bank is really, really good (like, it has enough money to qualify) and its owners agree (more than half of them!), it can ask for a change! With a **big vote** and **permission from the big boss (Comptroller)**, the bank can **become a national bank**! Its name will get a **new word: "National"!**

2. **Starting a New National Bank**  
  - But—**wait!**—the bank has to follow the state rules! The bank bosses (the directors) can write a special **certificate** that says, “Yep, we’re good to go!” After that, they can do all the paperwork to make it official!  
  - **Shares and directors stay the same** at first—no need to change right away!
  - Once the big boss (Comptroller) says everything's done right, **the bank becomes just like all other national banks**—it gets the same powers, rules, and responsibilities!

3. **Assets and Rules**  
  - The big boss (Comptroller) can let the bank keep some things, even if they’re not exactly what national banks usually have, but only **if it’s okay with the boss**.  
  - If the bank is in trouble (like being told by the state to fix big problems), it can’t turn into a national bank until it’s fixed! No shortcuts!

**Section 8: Let's Change Our Bank Name!**

**1. Turning a State Bank Into a National Bank**  
Okay, kids! Imagine you have a **bank** that’s part of a state (like a local clubhouse) and it wants to change its name to something more *official*. If the bank has **enough money** and **most of the owners agree**, they can ask the **Comptroller of the Currency** if they can turn into a **national bank**. It’s like turning your treehouse into a clubhouse, but now with a big fancy sign that says **"National"**!

**2. Organizing the New Bank**  
Before the bank changes into a national one, it has to make sure it's still following the rules of its state. The **bank directors** (the grown-ups in charge) will sign papers to make everything official. They’ll say that **51%** of the bank owners said, “Yes, let’s change!” Then, after some signatures and papers, the bank can start calling itself a **national bank**! The new national bank can keep its same **shares** and **directors** (for now), and everything else will follow the rules of the big, important national bank system!

**3. What Happens to the Bank’s Stuff?**  
Now, the **Comptroller of the Currency** will look at what stuff the bank has. If the bank has something that doesn’t follow the **national bank rules**, the **Comptroller** might let it keep it, but only if they think it’s okay. But, if the bank has been in trouble (like if a grown-up told it to stop doing something), the **Comptroller** won’t let it change to a national bank until it’s all cleared up!
