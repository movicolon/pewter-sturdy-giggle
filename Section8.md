**Section 8: Turning State Banks into National Banks!**

1. **Turning Into a National Bank**  
  - If a bank is really, really good (like, it has enough money to qualify) and its owners agree (more than half of them!), it can ask for a change! With a **big vote** and **permission from the big boss (Comptroller)**, the bank can **become a national bank**! Its name will get a **new word: "National"!**

2. **Starting a New National Bank**  
  - But—**wait!**—the bank has to follow the state rules! The bank bosses (the directors) can write a special **certificate** that says, “Yep, we’re good to go!” After that, they can do all the paperwork to make it official!  
  - **Shares and directors stay the same** at first—no need to change right away!
  - Once the big boss (Comptroller) says everything's done right, **the bank becomes just like all other national banks**—it gets the same powers, rules, and responsibilities!

3. **Assets and Rules**  
  - The big boss (Comptroller) can let the bank keep some things, even if they’re not exactly what national banks usually have, but only **if it’s okay with the boss**.  
  - If the bank is in trouble (like being told by the state to fix big problems), it can’t turn into a national bank until it’s fixed! No shortcuts!

That’s how a State bank can become a National one—lots of rules, but fun new powers and a cool new name
