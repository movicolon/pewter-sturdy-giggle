**Section 25A. Banky Banks Can Play Outside!**

1. **Let’s Make a Bank!**  
To make a bank that does business with other countries, or in places like Panama or the Philippines (yay!), you need at least five people to say “let's do it!” This bank can also be a helper for the U.S. Treasury in other places. So, the bank can help with money and work anywhere! 

2. **Why We Have Banks**  
The law says, “We want banks that can help everyone, from big companies to small farms, get money to trade stuff all around the world.” These banks can help with the U.S. trade and make sure the little guy can play too. The big boss of banks, called the *Federal Reserve*, makes the rules and checks every five years to see if things are still working.

3. **Making the Bank’s Plan**  
The people starting the bank write down the big plan and goals—what the bank is for and how it’s going to work. If they want to make extra rules, they can, as long as it’s not breaking the law.

4. **Sign and Go!**  
Once the plan is written, everyone who wants to help must sign it. Then, they send it to the *Federal Reserve*, who checks it, and once approved, the bank gets its shiny new permit to start working! 

5. **Paperwork Time**  
The people who sign the paper have to make it official by showing it to a judge or notary. Then, the *Federal Reserve* says, “Good job!” and the bank becomes a real thing that can sign contracts, own stuff, and get busy with business!

6. **Bank Powers – What It Can Do**  
The bank gets some cool powers like buying and selling notes, loans, and even coins! It can also open up branches in other countries and buy stock in other companies (with permission). The *Federal Reserve* watches to make sure everything is safe and fair.

7. **Save Money!**  
The bank can buy stock in another company if it’s trying to avoid losing money on something it already owes. But it has to sell it again pretty soon—unless the *Federal Reserve* says, “It’s okay to keep it a little longer.”

8. **Keep It Simple in the U.S.**  
The bank can’t do everything in the U.S.—just what it needs to do for its international business. And it can’t start working until the *Federal Reserve* says, “Okay, you’re ready!”

9. **No Playing Dirty with Prices**  
The bank can’t try to control prices of things in the market. If it does, bad things can happen—like fines or even going out of business. No funny business!

**Chapter 10: Let's Build Our Big Bank!**  
Okay, gang, here's the deal! When we start our big, fancy bank, we need to have **two million dollars**—that’s a lot of dough! But wait, we need to pay **one-quarter** of that right away before we can start playing business. Then, every two months, we have to give **10%** of what’s left until the whole two million is paid up. It’s like a game, but we gotta keep our promises! And if we get to the two million mark, we can pay the rest whenever the **Federal Reserve** says it’s okay! Just remember, no funny business: **we can't take money out of our piggy bank** (aka, the capital) until we get the okay from the grown-ups in charge.

**Chapter 11: Who Gets to Own Our Bank?**  
Guess what? We have to make sure that most of the people who own our bank are **U.S. citizens**—no foreign bosses allowed! But, if someone from a faraway land like **a foreign bank** wants to join in, they can! As long as they get a **green light** from the **Federal Reserve** first. So, no sneaky stuff; everyone’s gotta follow the rules!

**Chapter 12: Board Members Can't Play Double Duty!**  
The people who make the important decisions for our bank (like the **Board of Governors** at the **Federal Reserve**) can’t also be **directors or stockholders** in our bank. That would be like playing both sides in a game, and we don’t want that! They need to be all about **our bank’s best interests**—no cheating!

**Chapter 13: Who's Responsible for What We Owe?**  
Uh-oh, if we still owe money and we didn’t pay it, the **shareholders** (the people who own the bank) are **on the hook** for it! So, they have to be really careful not to let things get out of hand. Also, no matter what happens, our bank **can't** join the **Federal Reserve** club. Too bad, right?

**Chapter 14: Uh-Oh, We Didn’t Follow the Rules!**  
If our bank does something **bad** (like breaking the rules), then everything we’ve worked for might get taken away! But, before we can say “Oh no!”, a **court** has to say we broke the law, and then, the grown-ups at the **Federal Reserve** will tell us what to do. So, let's be good and play fair!

**Chapter 15: Let's Close the Bank if We Want To!**  
If the bank owners want to, they can **shut everything down** by voting together. It’s like playing a game of "stop," but they need to have **two-thirds** of everyone agreeing. So, if you want to **close shop**, make sure everyone is on board!

**Chapter 16: Who’s in Charge When Things Go Wrong?**  
Sometimes, the **Federal Reserve** can step in and say, "Hey, we need a new boss for the bank!" If our bank needs help, we can get a **receiver** (like a friendly grown-up who helps fix things). The **receiver** gets to make all the decisions, but everything they do has to follow the rules.

**Chapter 17: Let’s Stay Organized, Folks!**  
The bank needs to have meetings so we all know what’s going on! Every year, we’ll get together, see who owns stock, and make sure the **Federal Reserve** is getting all the reports it needs. **Examiners** will check on us to make sure we’re being good and not doing anything sneaky!

**Chapter 18: Time for a Snack—Dividends!**  
Sometimes, after all the hard work, we’ll have some profits! The **directors** get to decide if we give out some of those profits as a **dividend** (that’s like a reward). But, **before that** happens, we have to save a little bit, about **one-tenth** of our profits, so we can keep our piggy bank full and ready for the future.

**Chapter 19: Pay Up, Bank!**  
Our bank has to pay its **taxes** just like everyone else! If we live in a certain state, we have to pay the **state** a share. And, **the stock we own in the bank**? That’s like **personal property**, so we pay taxes on that, too! Not very fun, but it keeps us legal and out of trouble!

**Chapter 20: We Can Keep Playing!**  
Even though we set a time limit on our bank, we can **extend** the time it can keep going. All the shareholders have to agree (yep, another vote), and then, we ask the **Federal Reserve** to approve the extension. If they say "yes," we can keep playing for another **20 years**!

**Chapter 21: Turning from State to Federal!**  
Here’s a fun twist: if we start out as a **State Bank**, but we want to become a **Federal Bank**, we can! As long as **two-thirds** of the people who own our bank say “yes,” we can make the change. But, don’t forget: the **Federal Reserve** has to approve it. Once it’s approved, we’re good to go!

**Chapter 22: Naughty! Naughty!**  
If anyone in our bank does something **bad**, like stealing or lying to us, they get in **big trouble**. They could go to **jail** for up to **ten years** and maybe even get a **big fine**! So, be sure to play fair, kids!

**Chapter 23: No Blaming the United States!**  
Our bank can’t tell anyone that the **U.S. government** will pay for any of the **debts** we owe. If someone tries to say that, they’ll get into **serious trouble**, with a fine or even some **jail time**. No **lying** about the government!
