**Section 15. Money Fun Times!**

1. **Money Goes to the Fed!**  
The U.S. Treasury can send its money to Federal Reserve banks. These banks can also be helpers for the U.S. Treasury, making sure the government’s money is taken care of! They can hold cash, help with checks, and keep the government running smoothly. Yay, teamwork!

2. **Nonmember Banks Can Help Too!**  
Even if a bank isn’t part of the special group, the U.S. Treasury can still ask certain nonmember banks to hold its money. But only special banks are picked to help! So, don't worry—some banks get to be on the team, too!

3. **Farm Helpers!**  
Federal Reserve banks can also be the helpers for Farm Credit Banks. These special banks get help with money stuff, too! Fed banks to the rescue
