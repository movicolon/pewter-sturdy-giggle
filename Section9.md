**Section 9: State Banks Join the Club**

**1. Ask to Join**  
If a bank wants to join the **big bank club**, it asks the **bosses** at the **Fed**. The bank must show it has enough cash and is doing good business. If the **Fed** says yes, the bank gets to **buy stock** in the **Fed's club**.

**2. Stay in the Club**  
If a **big bank** changes into a **state bank**, it can stay in the **Fed club**. If a **big bank** and a **state bank** join, the new **state bank** can stay in the **Fed club**. But if a **big bank** joins and the **state bank** is out, the **Fed stock** must be sold.

**3. Keep Your Branches**  
If a **state bank** has **branches** that follow **state rules**, it can keep them when it joins the **Fed club**. But it can’t add more branches past where its **main bank** is. The **Fed** must approve it first.

**4. Check the Bank's Health**  
The **Fed bosses** look at how well the **bank** is run and if it fits the **rules**. If the **Fed** says yes, the bank can join.

**5. Pay for the Stock**  
Once the **Fed** says yes, the **bank** must pay for the stock. The **Fed** calls when it needs to pay.

**6. Follow the Rules**  
Banks that join must follow the **rules**, like **how much cash** to keep and **how to deal** with stock. They must give **reports** about their health and if they give out **dividends**. If the bank messes up its **report**, it has to pay a **fine**.

7. **Checkups**  
Banks must let the Fed check them. The Fed picks who checks them.

8. **State Checks**  
If the Fed likes a state check, they may use it. The Fed can make its own checks if needed. Banks may pay for checks, and the Fed can share the check with others.

9. **Lose Membership**  
If a bank breaks rules or quits work, the Fed may take its stock and kick it out. It can join again if it follows the rules.

10. **Quit Membership**  
A bank can leave the Fed by giving 6 months' notice and handing back its stock. The Fed may let it leave early. The Fed won't take too much stock in one year. When a bank quits, it can get back some cash.

11. **Capital to Join**  
A bank must have enough money to join the Fed. If it doesn't, it must have insurance for its deposits. Banks can’t drop their capital without the Fed’s okay.

12. **Waiver for Insured Banks**  
A bank with less money may still join the Fed if needed to stay insured. The Fed may ask it to get more money if needed.

13. **Follow the Law**  
Banks in the Fed must follow the law but still keep their state rights. They can't get big loans from the Fed unless they follow rules.

14. **Bad Checks**  
Bank workers can't say a check is good unless the money is there. If they do, the bank might lose its spot in the Fed.

15. **Gov Bank Jobs**  
Some banks hold gov cash if the gov asks. They must keep it safe. The gov makes sure they do it right.

16. **Join for Savings Banks**  
Banks with no stock can join if they have enough cash. They must pay a bit of stock. If the law stops them, they put cash in instead. They must follow the same rules as other banks.

17. **Reports from Helpers**  
Banks must get reports from helpers and send them to the Fed. The reports tell how things are going. They must be true and show how the helper works with the bank.

18. **More Reports**  
The Fed may ask for more reports from helpers if needed to see how the bank is doing.

19. **Oops! No Reports!**  
Uh-oh! If a bank forgets to get its reports, they gotta pay $100 each day! The Fed will make them pay, yikes!

20. **Stock Stuff**  
State banks can buy and sell stocks, just like national ones! But they gotta follow the same rules, giggle!

21. **Stock of Other Stuff**  
Banks can't say their stock is for other things, except for other banks or their building buddies, hee-hee! No funny business with stock transfers!

22. **Looky, Looky!**  
When banks get checked, they also gotta check their helpers! If a bank doesn't share info or doesn't wanna pay, uh-oh, the Fed might take away their membership, oh no!

23. **Helping People!**  
State banks can help communities by making investments that make life better, like housing or jobs! But they gotta be careful not to lose too much money, tee-hee! And there's a limit to how much they can invest, just to stay safe and sound!
