**Sec. 11A. Pricing of Services**

(a) By the sixth month after the enactment of the Monetary Control Act of 1980, the Board must publish pricing principles and a proposed fee schedule for Federal Reserve bank services to depository institutions. By the eighteenth month after enactment, the Board must begin implementing the fee schedule based on those principles.

(b) The services covered by the fee schedule include:
- Currency and coin services
- Check clearing and collection services
- Wire transfer services
- Automated clearinghouse services
- Settlement services
- Securities safekeeping services
- Federal Reserve float
- Any new services the Federal Reserve offers, such as electronic fund transfer services.

(c) The fee schedule shall be based on the following principles:
- All services will be explicitly priced.
- Services will be available to nonmember depository institutions at the same rates as member banks, subject to additional terms like sufficient balances.
- Fees will reflect direct and indirect costs, including interest on credited items, overhead, imputed costs, taxes, and capital return, while considering competitive factors and service availability nationwide.
- Interest on credited items will be charged at the current Federal funds market rate.

(d) The Board will require Federal Reserve banks to reduce their operating budgets proportionally to any decline in service volume, with any savings being paid into the U.S. Treasury.

(e) All depository institutions may receive deposits from other institutions or Federal Reserve bank offices, without regard to restrictions on the number or physical locations of the institutions.
