**Sec. 5. Stock Stuff; More or Less Money**

1. **How Many Shares; More or Less Money; Giving Back Shares**  
Each Federal Reserve bank has shares, and each share is worth $100. The shares can get bigger when banks grow or when new banks join, or get smaller if banks have less or leave. Banks can’t give away or borrow their shares.

When a bank gets more money, it has to buy more shares of the bank, like 6% of the new money. Half of that money is paid now, and the other half the big bosses can ask for later. If a bank wants shares after the bank is already set up, it has to buy 6% of the total money they have, and pay extra money each month since the last time it got paid.

If a bank gets smaller, it has to give back some shares. If it has too many shares, it gives back the extra ones. If the bank closes up, it gives all the shares back and doesn’t owe anything else. When shares are given back, they’re thrown away, and the bank gets some money back, plus a little extra, but not more than what the shares are worth, after taking away any money the bank owes.
