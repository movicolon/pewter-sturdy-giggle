**10A. Help for Banks**

1. **Banks Give Loans**  
Banks can lend to groups of five or more banks if five board members say yes. The group of banks must be mostly owned by separate people. They can borrow if they donâ€™t have enough to get credit. Banks only owe part of the loan based on how much they owe. They can share the loan with others in the group, but the loan must have good security. The bank will charge more than its discount rate.

2. **Foreign Debt Not Allowed**  
Banks can't use foreign debt as security for loans.

3. **Banks Can Promise**  
Banks can agree to follow the rules in this section
