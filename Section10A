**10A. Big Help Time!**

1. **Bank Help Time**  
Banks go *help* when lots of banks can’t get enough cash. They ask the boss (5 of them) to say “yes.” The bank gives cash, but the banks share it. Each gets only what their part is. They each need a “promise note” and give a “big thing” (collateral). Banks pay a little more, like *one* extra coin. The promise note can’t be used for big cash later.

2. **No Foreign Help**  
Banks can’t use *other countries’* stuff for the cash.

3. **Banks Say “Yes”**  
Banks say “okay” to follow the rules and get help.
