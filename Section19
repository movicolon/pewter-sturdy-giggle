Money Rules For Banks Far Away

Banks far away must keep money, just like big banks here. Rules say how much.

Big banks far away must keep money for:

Money owed to other banks.
Money given to folks in this land from banks far away.
Things banks far away got from banks here.
Skip Some Money Rules

Some banks do not need to keep money if money stays far away. But big bosses can still make rules for big banks.

Help With Money

Banks with money people move or save can get help, just like big banks. Big bosses check what banks need to keep money safe.

Step-By-Step Money Rules

Banks must keep more money bit by bit. If a bank worked on July 1, 1979, but was not in the big bank club, it must keep:

A tiny bit first year.
A small bit next year.
A little more each year.
After many years, full rules.
Old Big Banks Get Time

If a bank was in the big bank club before new rules, it can keep less money at first:

First year, keep less.
Next year, keep a bit more.
After more years, full rules.
New Big Banks Get Time

If a bank joins later, it can keep less money at first:

First year, small bit.
Next year, more.
After more years, full rules.
Banks Far Away Get Time



If a bank is far, far away, it does not keep money for some years. Later, it must keep more, bit by bit, till full rules.

Who Follows the Rules?

Some banks do not need to follow these rules. A bank is free if it:

Only works with other banks.
Is mostly owned by those banks.
Does not help regular people.
Special Rule Breaks

If a bank boss says a bank can skip money rules, it can also skip these rules.

Small Banks Get a Break

If a bank has less than $2,000,000 in certain money, it follows a zero rule.
The bank can pick which accounts follow the zero rule, but checking accounts that should have a small rule must follow the zero rule.
Small banks donâ€™t have to report as much as big banks.
Changes Every Year

Every year, the money limit grows if banks have more total money.
If all banks have less money than before, the limit does not change.

**Banks Earn Money Too**  

**Getting Paid**  
Banks that keep money at the Federal Reserve can earn interest. They get paid at least four times a year, but not more than the usual short-term interest rates.  

**Rules for Payments**  
The Board makes the rules for:  
- How and when banks get paid.  
- How the money is shared with the banks that hold balances.  
- What banks, loan groups, and credit unions must do to handle the payments.  

**Who Counts as a Bank?**  
Besides regular banks, these also count:  
- Trust companies.  
- Certain corporations under special banking laws.  
- Foreign bank branches in the U.S.
