**Sec. 6. Banks Go Bye-Bye**

1. **If a Bank Can’t Pay Bills**  
If a bank can’t pay its bills and someone is put in charge to clean up, the shares it has in the Federal Reserve bank go away. The bank still owes what it owes, though. All the money the bank paid for the shares, plus a little extra (half of 1% for each month since the last time it got paid), will be used to pay off what it owes to the Federal Reserve bank. If there’s any money left after that, the person cleaning up the bank gets it.

[12 USC 288. As changed by the big people on April 23, 1930 (46 Stat. 250).]

2. **If a Bank Stops Doing Bank Stuff**  
If a bank stops doing its job for 60 days and no one has kicked it out yet, the Comptroller of the Currency can step in and appoint someone to take charge. The shares that bank has in the Federal Reserve bank are gone, and the bank will get back some of the money it paid for those shares. It also gets a little extra (half of 1% a month) until the last time it got paid. The bank will get back no more than what the shares were worth, after taking out any money it still owes.

[12 USC 288. As added by the big people on April 23, 1930 (46 Stat. 250). As changed by the big people on Aug. 23, 1935 (49 Stat. 713).
