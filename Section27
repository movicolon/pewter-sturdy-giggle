**Sec. 27. Tax on Notes**

1. **Bank Acts:**  
The rules from 1908 are stretched to 1915. Some rules on how banks print money are redone to match older ones.

2. **Tax on Notes:**  
Banks with notes not tied to bonds pay tax.  
- First, 3% a year on the notes.  
- Then, add Â½% a month till it hits 6%.  
- After, it stays at 6%.  
The Treasury Secretary can change the rules. Banks must keep some gold in the Treasury. Some state banks may join in too.

[As changed in 1914.
