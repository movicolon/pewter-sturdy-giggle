**Sec. 4. Federal Reserve Banks**

1. **Organization of Reserve Banks**  
Once the committee sets the districts as in section two, it files a certificate with the Comptroller showing the district limits and the designated Federal reserve city. The Comptroller then sends application forms to each national bank in the district, and to other eligible banks. These forms include a resolution for the bank's board to approve, allowing a subscription to the capital stock of the Federal reserve bank in that district.
