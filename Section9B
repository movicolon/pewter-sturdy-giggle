**9B. Fix Bank Help!**

(a) **Take Over**  
Board can put a *boss* in charge of banks that aren’t safe. They run the bank just like *other* big banks do.

(b) **Board Power**  
Board has *same* power over these banks as the big boss does for *other* banks.

(c) **Bankruptcy**  
If needed, the Board can tell the boss to ask for help from *court* to fix the bank. Rules will follow the court’s way, not old rules
