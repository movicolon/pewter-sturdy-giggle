**Section 7: Dividends and Fun Money!**

1. **Stockholder Dividends**  
  - **Yay! Dividends!** After all the bills are paid, the people who own the bank’s stock get some money! How much?  
    - Big stockholders (with lots of money, over $10 billion!) get the *smaller* of:
      - The big, fancy Treasury note amount or
      - **6%** of their money!
    - Smaller stockholders (less than $10 billion) always get **6%**!
  - **Cumulative?** Yes! You get more money *next* time if you didn’t get it all before!  
  - **Inflation?** The number for "big" and "small" stockholders will change with prices, thanks to the smart Board people!

2. **Fun Surplus Money**  
  - After giving out all the dividends, any extra bank money goes into a special fund!
  - But there’s a **limit** on how much extra money can stay in the bank's piggy bank: **$6,825,000,000**! Any extra goes to the U.S. Treasury! 

3. **Big Payments for Year 2000!**  
  - The Federal Reserve banks must give **$3,752,000,000** to the Treasury! That’s a lot of money for that year! 
  - The Board of Governors decides how much each bank gives.
  - No more adding extra money to the piggy bank that year!  

4. **Treasury's Turn to Use Money**  
  - The Treasury can use the Federal Reserve’s money for things like:
    - Helping the gold stash!
    - Paying off U.S. debt!
  - If the bank ever closes, any leftover money goes straight to the U.S. Treasury!

5. **No Taxes!**  
  - Federal Reserve banks don’t pay taxes—**yay!**—except for property taxes!

And that’s how the big bank money works in the Federal Reserve! Fun, right
