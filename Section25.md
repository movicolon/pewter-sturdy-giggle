**Section 25: Let's Play Bank Around the World!**

**1. Capital and Surplus to Play With Powers!**  
Alright, gang! If a bank has **$1,000,000 or more** (wow, that’s a lot of Monopoly money!), it can ask the **Federal Reserve** if it can do some fun stuff, like:

- **Make branches in other countries** or in **U.S. territories**—you know, places far, far away to help bring goods from the U.S. to those places! They even might act as **money helpers** for the U.S. if needed!
- **Invest in other banks** around the world, but not more than **10%** of their total stock and savings. That’s like buying a tiny piece of the action!
- **Own stock in foreign banks** that don’t do business in the U.S. except when it’s needed for international stuff. And if the bank follows the rules, they can even lend some money to those foreign banks!

**2. Playing with Foreign Banks Before 1921!**  
Before **January 1, 1921**, a bank, even if it doesn’t have **$1,000,000**, could still ask the **Federal Reserve** to invest some of its money (up to **5%**) in companies that help ship goods from the U.S. to foreign lands. But no matter what, they can’t invest more than **10%** of what they’ve got.

**3. Asking for Permission to Play!**  
If a bank wants to play in the foreign branch game, they have to ask the **Federal Reserve** first. They’ll need to tell them how much money they have, what they want to do, and where they want to play. The **Federal Reserve** can say “Yes!” or “Not right now” if they think it’s a good idea.

**4. Checking Up on the Foreign Fun!**  
Every time a bank opens up a foreign branch, they have to give the **Comptroller** some info about how the branch is doing. If a bank invests in another company, it has to tell the **Federal Reserve** too. And guess what? The **Federal Reserve** might send someone to check on how everything’s going, just to make sure no one’s making a mess!

**5. No Sneaky Business!**  
Before any bank buys stock in a foreign company, that company has to promise to play by the **Federal Reserve’s** rules. If the company doesn’t follow the rules, the **Federal Reserve** can step in, investigate, and even make the bank sell its stock if things go wrong!

**6. Foreign Branches Keep Their Own Books!**  
Each branch in a foreign land has to keep its **own accounts** separate from the others. So, if a branch in France makes money, it has to show that money all by itself in its books. No mixing up those numbers with the other branches, thank you very much!

**7. Extra Powers for Fun!**  
The **Federal Reserve** can let foreign branches do some extra things, but they have to be careful. These branches can’t start buying, selling, or making things—no toy stores, no lemonade stands! They can do other banking stuff, though, as long as it’s okay with the **Federal Reserve**.
