**Sec. 13A. Farm Paper Deals**

**1. Fed banks can back farm notes**  
If a member bank says it’s cool, a Fed bank can back farm notes. They must be less than 9 months old. They can use these notes to back Fed money, but only if they’re tied to goods like crops or livestock.

**2. Fed can back farm credit notes**  
Fed banks can back notes from farm credit banks, but not if a nonmember bank says it’s okay. These notes must be 9 months old or less and tied to farm loans.

**3. Buy and sell farm credit bonds**  
Fed banks can buy and sell bonds from farm credit banks or the National Ag Credit Corp., just like they do with bonds from the farm loan act.

**4. Co-ops can use farm paper**  
Co-ops that help farmers can use paper for farm work, like paying farmers or buying goods. These notes are treated like farm paper.

**5. Limits on paper**  
The Fed can set limits on how much farm paper a bank can back, based on its size, especially if the notes are over 3 months old.
